        "If the treatment had not been randomly assigned, our test would still point toward an association between the treatment and back pain outcomes among our 31 patients. **But beware**: without randomization, this association would not imply that the treatment caused a change in back pain outcomes. For example, if the patients themselves had chosen whether to administer the treatment, perhaps the patients experiencing more pain would be more likely to choose the treatment and more likely to experience some reduction in pain even without medication. Pre-existing pain would then be a confounding factor in the analysis."
