        "### Another Case Study:  Mendel's Pea Plants\n",
        "\n",
        "[Gregor Mendel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel) (1822-1884) was an Austrian monk who is widely recognized as the founder of the modern field of genetics. Mendel performed careful and large-scale experiments on plants to come up with fundamental laws of genetics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Many of his experiments were on varieties of pea plants. He formulated sets of assumptions about each variety; these were his models. He then tested the validity of his models by growing the plants and gathering data.\n",
        "\n",
        "For pea plants of a particular variety, Mendel proposed the following model.\n",
        "\n",
        "For every plant, there is a 75% chance that it will have purple flowers, and a 25% chance that the flowers will be white, regardless of the colors in all the other plants.\n",
        "\n",
        "To see whether his model was valid, Mendel grew 929 pea plants of this variety. Among these 929 plants, 705 had purple flowers.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use these data to perform a test of hypotheses and see if Mendel’s model looks good.\n",
        "\n",
        "All statistical tests attempt to choose between two views of the world. Specifically, the choice is between two views about how the data were generated. These two views are called hypotheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The null hypothesis.** This is a clearly defined model about chances. It says that the data were generated at random under clearly specified assumptions about the randomness. The word “null” reinforces the idea that if the data look different from what the null hypothesis predicts, the difference is due to nothing but chance.\n",
        "\n",
        "From a practical perspective, **the null hypothesis is a hypothesis under which you can simulate data.**\n",
        "\n",
        "In the example about Mendel’s model for the colors of pea plants, the null hypothesis is that the assumptions of his model are good: each plant has a 75% chance of having purple flowers, independent of all other plants.\n",
        "\n",
        "Under this hypothesis, we can simulate random samples by using sample_proportions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The alternative hypothesis. This says that some reason other than chance made the data differ from the predictions of the model in the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the example about Mendel’s plants, the alternative hypothesis is simply that his model isn’t good.\n",
        "\n",
        "Keep in mind that the alternative doesn’t say how or why the model isn’t good. It just says the model isn’t good.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to decide between the two hypothesis, we must choose a statistic that we can use to make the decision. This is called the **test statistic.**\n",
        "\n",
        "We will be comparing two categorical distributions: the one in Mendel’s model and the one we will get in our random sample. We want to see if these two distributions are close to each other or far apart. So a natural test statistic is the total variation distance (TVD).\n"
