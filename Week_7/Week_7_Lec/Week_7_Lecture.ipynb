In particular, we’re going to assume that we have access to training data: a bunch of observations, where we know the class of each observation. The collection of these pre-classified observations is also called a training set. A classification algorithm is going to analyze the training set, and then come up with a classifier: an algorithm for predicting the class of future observations."
