Someone with cancer can receive a negative result.  (\"Positive\" means \"pointing toward cancer,\" so in this context it's bad!)  Doctors and patients often deal poorly with the first case, called *false positives*.  For example, a patient may receive dangerous treatment like chemotherapy or radiation despite having no cancer or, as happens more frequently, having a cancer that would not have impacted their health.\n",
        "\n",
